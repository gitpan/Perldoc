README for Perldoc 0.13
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a preliminary release of Perldoc.  Perldoc is a bit like SAX,
but without the implied "XML".  As well as being like SAX, it
specifies a DOM-like API to let you navigate built structures, too.

Having said that, XML parsing and writing classes are provided as a
baseline.

This project is available via subversion;

  svn://utsl.gen.nz/trunk/Perldoc

Commit access will be handed out liberally to those interested in
working on Perldoc; contact me (samv@cpan.org) for an account.
